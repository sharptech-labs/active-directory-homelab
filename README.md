# Active Directory Home Lab (2026)
*A complete, step-by-step lab environment for learning and practicing real Active Directory administration at home.*

<br>

## Overview

This repository provides a fully documented, reproducible Active Directory home lab designed for anyone who wants hands-on experience with Windows Server, domain services, and real IT administration workflows.

Every module includes:

- Clear step-by-step instructions  
- Screenshots for every major action  
- Realistic configuration tasks  
- A structure that mirrors real helpdesk and sysadmin work  

This lab is also part of my own ongoing skill development as I strengthen my Active Directory, Windows Server, and general IT administration experience.

## Who This Lab Is For

- Beginners who want a guided, safe environment to learn AD  
- Helpdesk / IT Support candidates preparing for interviews  
- Students building practical experience for their resume  
- Anyone who wants to understand how Windows domains actually work  
- Home lab builders who want a clean, modular project to follow  

No prior AD experience is required — each module builds on the last.

## Lab Structure

### 01 — Windows Server 2022 VM Setup  
Prepare a Windows Server 2022 virtual machine in VirtualBox, install Guest Additions, and configure the environment for domain controller deployment.

### 02 — Windows 11 VM Setup  
Create a Windows 11 client VM, configure networking, bypass VirtualBox TPM limitations, and prepare it for domain joining.

### 03 — Active Directory Domain Services (Coming Soon)  
Install AD DS, promote the server to a domain controller, configure DNS, and establish the core domain environment.

### 04 — Join Windows 11 to the Domain (Coming Soon)  
Connect the client machine to the domain and validate authentication, DNS, and trust relationships.

### 05 — Users, Groups, and OUs (Coming Soon)  
Create and manage users, security groups, and organizational units following real-world best practices.

### 06 — Group Policy (Coming Soon)  
Deploy and test GPOs for security, configuration, and user experience management.

### 07 — DHCP, NAT, and Routing (Coming Soon)  
Configure DHCP scopes, NAT, and routing services to simulate a functional internal network.

### 08 — Helpdesk Ticket Simulations (Coming Soon)  
Troubleshoot realistic AD issues such as password resets, lockouts, DNS failures, and domain join errors.

### 09 — Patch Management (Coming Soon)  
Implement Windows Update rings, WSUS concepts, and patch deployment strategies to simulate real-world update management.

### 10 — Reporting and Audit (Coming Soon)  
Explore event logs, auditing policies, AD reporting tools, and methods for monitoring domain activity.
