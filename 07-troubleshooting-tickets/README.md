<h1>07-Troubleshooting Tickets (Tier‑1 Active Directory Challenge)</h1>

<p>
  This module features a set of troubleshooting tickets from a Tier‑1 Active Directory challenge created by 
  <strong>jakehulberg</strong>. I built and configured my Server 2022 Active Directory environment specifically 
  to run this challenge and work through each issue. A break script will be introduced in this module to intentionally 
  create problems within the domain controller. My goal is to solve each ticket and document the issue, my 
  troubleshooting process, and the final resolution.

<p>Tickets are stored as simple numbered Markdown files inside the <code>tickets</code> folder:</p>

  ticket-1.md
